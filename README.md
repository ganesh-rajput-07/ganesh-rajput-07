# 👋 Hi, I’m Ganesh Rajput

I build software by understanding how things work under the hood.

My focus is on **strong foundations**, **clean system design**, and **security-aware development**.  
I spend time with the fundamentals — operating systems, data flow, computation models — because solid systems are built there, not in shortcuts.

I value correctness over cleverness and longevity over trends.
---

### Profile
Foundations-driven software engineer with hands-on experience in system-level programming, backend development, and security-focused design. Strong grounding in core computer science concepts with practical implementation experience. Comfortable working close to the system and scaling upward when needed.

---

### Technical Skills

**Programming Languages**
- C, Python, JavaScript

**Frameworks & Tools**
- Django, React
- PostgreSQL
- Git, GitHub
- Linux (primary development environment)

**Core Computer Science**
- Data Structures and Algorithms
- Theory of Computation
- Compiler Design
- Cryptography fundamentals
- Big Data concepts (HDFS, MapReduce, NoSQL)

---

### Engineering Achievements

- Implemented multiple cryptographic techniques ranging from classical ciphers to modern public-key concepts in C
- Designed and built backend systems with security and data integrity as core requirements
- Worked extensively in Linux-based environments, handling system configuration and troubleshooting independently
- Translated theoretical computer science concepts into working code implementations
- Built CLI-first tools before extending functionality to GUI-based interfaces
- Debugged real-world dependency, build, and runtime issues across frontend and backend stacks

---

### Systems & Security Experience

- Designed software assuming untrusted and adversarial environments
- Studied encryption, hashing, and key exchange mechanisms at the algorithm level
- Focused on privacy-aware data handling and misuse prevention
- Emphasized correctness, predictability, and maintainability in system design

---

### Academic & Conceptual Strengths

- Strong understanding of formal languages, automata, and computability
- Practical exposure to compiler phases including lexical analysis, parsing, and error handling
- Compared traditional data processing systems with distributed big-data architectures
- Applied time and space complexity analysis in real implementations

---

### Project Experience

- Built end-to-end software projects from design to deployment
- Prioritized clean architecture and readable code over quick solutions
- Iteratively improved systems based on testing and failure analysis
- Balanced academic rigor with practical engineering constraints

---

### Learning & Growth

- Consistently studies low-level system behavior alongside modern frameworks
- Uses implementation as the primary learning method
- Revisits fundamentals to strengthen advanced system understanding
- Treats engineering growth as a long-term discipline

---

### Direction

Focused on contributing to and building systems that:
- Scale without unnecessary complexity
- Remain secure under real-world pressure
- Are understandable, maintainable, and durable
