# 👋 Hi, I’m Ganesh Rajput

I build software by understanding how things work under the hood.

My focus is on **strong foundations**, **clean system design**, and **security-aware development**.  
I spend time with the fundamentals — operating systems, data flow, computation models — because solid systems are built there, not in shortcuts.

I value correctness over cleverness and longevity over trends.

---

## 🧠 What I Work On

- Backend systems and APIs
- Linux-based development environments
- Security-oriented tools and workflows
- Data systems and distributed computing concepts
- Low-level understanding of high-level abstractions

I prefer software that is predictable, readable, and hard to misuse.

---

## 🛠 Technologies & Tools

### Languages
- **C** — algorithms, memory, fundamentals
- **Python** — backend logic, automation, tooling
- **JavaScript** — frontend and integration

### Frameworks & Platforms
- Django
- React
- PostgreSQL
- Git & GitHub
- Linux (primary environment)

### Core Computer Science
- Data Structures & Algorithms
- Theory of Computation
- Compiler Design
- Cryptography fundamentals
- Big Data basics (HDFS, MapReduce, NoSQL)

---

## 🔐 Current Focus

- Designing **secure data-sharing and communication systems**
- Building tools with minimal assumptions and maximum control
- Understanding system behavior at scale
- Writing code that survives refactors, audits, and time

If a system fails, I want to know *why* — not just *where*.

---

## 🚀 Projects

The repositories here reflect:
- Incremental, well-reasoned development
- Emphasis on fundamentals over libraries
- Real learning, not tutorial cloning
- Practical problem-solving

Some projects are experiments.  
Some are serious builds.  
All of them represent deliberate growth.

---

## 📚 How I Learn

- Start from first principles
- Question abstractions
- Read specifications and documentation
- Break systems to understand them
- Fix problems instead of working around them

Strong engineers are built by depth, not noise.

---

## 📌 Long-Term Direction

I’m preparing myself for work involving:
- Large-scale systems
- Security-critical software
- Infrastructure and backend architecture
- Products designed to last beyond hype cycles

Quiet progress compounds.

---

## 🤝 Collaboration

If you care about:
- clean architecture
- fundamentals that don’t age
- thoughtful engineering

then we’ll likely work well together.
